# Lab 01: Multi-threading

The aim of the first lab is to get you started with threads in C++.  We will start with CMake in different programming environments.  Once setup, we will look at different methods of thread creation: functions and lambda expressions.  We will then examine data gathering to understand parallel performance, using the Monte Carlo Pi benchmark as an example.  Then for those of you with time we will look at user-level threads with Boost.Fiber and how to use R for data analysis.

## Setting Up

### Visual Studio

### CLion

### Command Line

### Our Starting CMake File

## Starting a Thread

Creating a thread in C++ is simple - we need to include the thread header file:

```cpp
#include <thread>
```

We then create a new thread object in our application, passing in the name of the function to execute:

```cpp
thread t(hello_world);
```

This will create a new thread that will execute the function `hello world`. The thread will start executing the function while the main application continues executing. The main application is itself a thread that is created and launched on application start.

### Waiting for a Thread to Complete

When we launch a thread we want to wait for it to complete. To do this we use the `join` method on the `thread`.

```cpp
t.join();
```

This will pause the current execution until the joined `thread` completes.

### First Multi-threaded Example

We can now create our first multi-threaded application.  This is a *Hello World* example illustrating the basics.

```cpp
#include <thread>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std ;

/*
This is the function called by the thread
*/
void hello_world()
{
    cout << "Hello from thread " << this_thread::get_id() << endl ;
}

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    // Create a new thread
    thread t(hello_world);
    // Wait for thread to finish (join it)
    t.join();
    // Return 0 (OK)
    return 0;
}
```

We use the following instruction:

```cpp
this_thread::get_id()
```

which gets the (operating system) assigned ID of the `thread` running.  Each time you run the application, you should get a different value.  The output of your application should be as follows:

```shell
Hello from thread 16196
```
